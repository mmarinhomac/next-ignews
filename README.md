## About ig.news

is a blog where users can access the content of each post according to the status of their subscription.

The blog has a purchase system integrated with STRIPE, and after the user makes the payment, his subscription will be active and ready to view the complete content of the entire blog. If the user does not wish to opt for the subscription, he will have limited access to the content of the posts. And all the data needed to make signatures or user data checks are saved in the FaunaDB database.
